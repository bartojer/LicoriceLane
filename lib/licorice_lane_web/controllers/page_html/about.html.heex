        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 leading-8">
          Founded in 1987 by candy enthusiast Margaret Sweet, Licorice Lane began as a small family business with a simple mission: to bring the world's finest licorice to candy lovers everywhere. What started as a single storefront has grown into a beloved destination for confection connoisseurs.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 leading-8">
          Margaret's passion for authentic, high-quality licorice led her to travel across Europe and beyond, building relationships with artisan producers who share her commitment to excellence. Today, her daughter Sarah continues this tradition, ensuring every piece of candy meets our exacting standards.
